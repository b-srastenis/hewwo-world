# About Me

I'm really out of ways to casually and succinctly talk about having two names - yet here we are :).

My name is Brooke or Sage or Sage/Brooke or Brooke/Sage and I have no idea what's going on a lot of the time.

For pronouons I use she, her, hers alongside they, them, theirs, and fae, fae, faer (a really rad set of neopronouns!).	

If you'd like to know how to conjugate my neopronouns you can find a resource [here](https://en.pronouns.page/fae).	

## Interests

In no particular order, here's some things that are of interest to me:

1. I'm interested in both academic and public librarianship
2. I'm also very intersted in getting a spell checker for Notepad++ because I feel like I'm constantly misspelling words without one
3. That one conspirarcy started on reddit that Findland doesn't actually exist

## Tools/methods

Here's some things I'm interested in exploring more in the class: 

1. I'm very scared, yet excited, to do some coding and learn more about computers in less of a "magic box" sense
2. The readings about emotional labor really struck a cord with me - I'd love to read more about that in DH
3. Uhhhh... why **do** they call it Python?
